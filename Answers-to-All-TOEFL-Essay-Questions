It has been noticed that..,It is obvious that,..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8 -------------------------------
To agree or disagree with the statement that[]is a matter of balancing its pros and cons.
However,if one considers the following reasons,he or she may disagree with the title statement as I do.
First,some people may hold the view that..,In addition,So in my point of view..
---------------------------
There are always good and bad consequences following..there are advantages and disadvantages of everything created on earth.
It depends on human beings to utilize or exploit them.In brief..
---------------------------
I strongly agree with the statement that..this is a very interesting and thought provoking statement,and I have specific reasons
for agreeing with it,which are explained in the following paragraphs. ,Among all these,
---------------------------
I do strongly support the statement that,..This I support with the following reasons.First let me describe the role..

---------------------------
However when it comes to me,..for the following reasons.In the first place,..In the second place,..Admittedly,..And such positive effects of[]should not be neglected.
However,it seems to me that disadvantages brought by[]have outweighed its advantages.All in all,if all the factors are contemplated,we can easily reach a conclusion that..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9 -------------------------------
..I have experienced the good and bad sides of both.Some may choose to[],while other like the[].As far as I am concerned,I would like to[]because[]has more advantages

of the..Moreover,..
---------------------------
Taking this into consideration,I would prefer[].People are always wondering whether[].
If there is one preference which I take leave to make a conclusion then it is[]rather than[].
There widespread testimonies for it and the primary one are listed as follows.
---------------------------
The foremost reason for..Oppositely,..On the contrary,..Nevertheless,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 ------------------------------
..is a well-known adage.But again these are merely reasons that can't be given preference.As for me,I would like to side with the former people.

All in all,from what I have been discussed above,I suggest..,..There are two different opinions,Some people claim that[].Other people,however argue that..
As far as I am concerned,no matter whether[]or not,Although i agree that there are maybe one or two advantages of not[],
I insist that the advantages of[]far overweigh that of[].

some people may believe that..,but I really disagree with them about it.

For some people,[] for others,[].Of course,the opinions depend on personality of individuals,culture,..and place among others.

there are many attributes of[].first of all,..In such a situation,..there may be cases where there are[]In such cases..

In my opinion,..while at the same time,..As an important and fundamental quality of[],..Other than that.
however,most of the time,
It seems,among so many qualities such as reliability,honesty..and patience,very difficult to prefer one to another because each of them has its unique advantages.
Yet that does not mean that they are of the same weight to me.To be frank,I would prefer[].
why I vote for[]? I stand behind it because[]. []is another quality that i have chosen to illustrate here.
Of course,other qualities such as..are also important to some context,but everybody has his or her own preferences.
