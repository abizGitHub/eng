To agree or disagree with the statement that[]is a matter of balancing its pros and cons.
However,if one considers the following reasons,he or she may disagree with the title statement as I do.
First,some people may hold the view that..,In addition,So in my point of view..
---------------------------
There are always good and bad consequences following..there are advantages and disadvantages of everything created on earth.
It depends on human beings to utilize or exploit them.In brief..
---------------------------
I strongly agree with the statement that..this is a very interesting and thought provoking statement,and I have specific reasons
for agreeing with it,which are explained in the following paragraphs. ,Among all these,
---------------------------
I do strongly support the statement that,..This I support with the following reasons.First let me describe the role..
Last but not least I wish to say that I consider..
---------------------------
This is the good side of..the fact that..has recently brought a problem to focus:whether..However,I hold just an opposite point of view
and I will demonstrate my opinion as followed.First of all,the advantages of..As known to all,..The good case in the point is that..Besides,..
I do not deny that there may be some cases that..Thus,for the reasons above,I shall say:
---------------------------
However when it comes to me,..for the following reasons.In the first place,..In the second place,..Admittedly,..And such positive effects of[]should not be neglected.
However,it seems to me that disadvantages brought by[]have outweighed its advantages.All in all,if all the factors are contemplated,we can easily reach a conclusion that..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9 -------------------------------
..I have experienced the good and bad sides of both.Some may choose to[],while other like the[].As far as I am concerned,I would like to[]because[]has more advantages
than[].To begin with,..Therefore,..For example,..Furthermore,In addition,..Some may argue that..However,..In conclusion,I strongly hold that[]is much better than[]because
of the..Moreover,..
---------------------------
Taking this into consideration,I would prefer[].People are always wondering whether[].
If there is one preference which I take leave to make a conclusion then it is[]rather than[].
There widespread testimonies for it and the primary one are listed as follows.
---------------------------
The foremost reason for..Oppositely,..On the contrary,..Nevertheless,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 ------------------------------
..is a well-known adage.But again these are merely reasons that can't be given preference.As for me,I would like to side with the former people.
Some people believed that[],whereas other people believed that[].as for me,I would like to side with the former people.
I am willing to discuss it by proposing two main reasons.First,..Second..I support the former point of view.If we acknowledge that[]we would lose the moral principle..
This is because most people are willing to..,As for me,I would like to..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11 ------------------------------
When it comes to the issue of[],some people suggest that[],while others maintain the opposite view.As far as I am concerned,the former point carries more weight.
I take this view on account of the following reasons.First of all,..Second point to take into account is that..,Last not least,..
just as the English proverb goes,"a coin has two sides" those who take the opposite view..,I still believe that..
---------------------------
I disagree strongly with the idea that..,this is one of the main reasons why..,the opposite opinion is that..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12 ------------------------------
As we have known,..In most cases,..On the other hand,..As a result,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13 ------------------------------
As far as I am concerned,I prefer to..,Of course these are some advantages to..,Firstly,..In addition,Furthermore..
However,I prefer to..,The main reason is that..Another reason is that..General speaking,.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14 ------------------------------
All in all,from what I have been discussed above,I suggest..,..There are two different opinions,Some people claim that[].Other people,however argue that..
As far as I am concerned,no matter whether[]or not,Although i agree that there are maybe one or two advantages of not[],
I insist that the advantages of[]far overweigh that of[].
Although I agree that there are maybe one or two advantages of[],I insist that the advantages of[]far overweigh that of[].
In the first place,..In the second..In conclusion,I believe that..because.In short,..
---------------------------
some people may believe that..,but I really disagree with them about it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15 ------------------------------
For some people,[] for others,[].Of course,the opinions depend on personality of individuals,culture,..and place among others.
but both points of view may come to an agreement when determining[].
There are so many more characteristics that we could list,and there are many ways we could make a more accurate picture of the[]
---------------------------
there are many attributes of[].first of all,..In such a situation,..there may be cases where there are[]In such cases..
It is said that..In my point of view,these are three conspicuous aspects of the qualities of[].
One of the most important characteristics of[],On the other hand,..another important aspect of[].In the same way..
All in all,..Taking into account of all these factors,we may reach the conclusion that[]
---------------------------
In my opinion,..while at the same time,..As an important and fundamental quality of[],..Other than that.
however,most of the time,
It seems,among so many qualities such as reliability,honesty..and patience,very difficult to prefer one to another because each of them has its unique advantages.
Yet that does not mean that they are of the same weight to me.To be frank,I would prefer[].
why I vote for[]? I stand behind it because[]. []is another quality that i have chosen to illustrate here.
Of course,other qualities such as..are also important to some context,but everybody has his or her own preferences.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16 ------------------------------
people may have different opinions.some people will be against it because of..,etc.other people,however,will welcome it very much.
as far as I am concerned,I like [].In the first place,..As we know,..As a result,..In the second place,..Sometimes,..In addition,..
---------------------------
I personally have positive feelings toward this proposal and also believe that..shall also feel excited about such an event.
In conclusion..So I personally welcome such a plan.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17 ------------------------------
..My arguments for this point are listed as follows.First,..what is more,..Last but not least,..In short,I prefer[].
I choose[].some people prefer to[] they think that they[].There is some truth in it,but they fail to see the many advantages of[].
As far as I am concerned,I would like to[].Firstly,..as we all know,..secondly,[] is one matter,while[] is another.
some people may argue that[].for instance,..It seems that this turns out to be another advantage of[].I short,I prefer..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18 ------------------------------
Though everyone[],I think there are the same standards judging[]in several aspects.
when asked what are[],different people hold different perspective,due to their different experiences.
after pondering this question on my occasions,I sum up three vital qualities that[]should possess.
In my understanding,the most essential trait of[]is that[].as an english proverb says,"Example is better than precept."
another crucial feature of[].the last but not the least vital feature of[].By saying that,I do not mean that[].what i mean is that[]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19 ------------------------------
[]is among the most important factors affecting the[].there are many advantages in[],however these advantages cannot surpass the advantages of[].
the most important advantages of[]include..However there are also many advantages in[]
In conclusion,although there are many advantages in[],there are more advantages in[].So,-should consider-as its first priority in-
---------------------------
This problem is a much-debated one in that it affects everybody in his or her daily life.
personally speaking,I would be one of those who argue that[]should[].
Though it is quite rational for average people to choose[]because of the obvious reason that[].A close scrutiny of the potential benefits of choosing[]
would reveal how[].
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 20 ------------------------------
there are advantages and disadvantages for[].it's hard to say which is better.the answer to this question differs from individual to individual.
as far as i am concerned,it is better for[].some people argue that[],for one thing..for another,..On the contrary..
Although I do agree that[]has one or more advantages,I insist that it is far better to choose.To begin with,..In addition,.. as a result..
last but not least,..In conclusion,I believe that it is better for[]not only because[],but also because..
---------------------------
I think that it is better..because..It is said that..In my point of view,I strongly agree that[]
First,..On the other hand,..Another benefit of[]is that..Finally..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 21 ------------------------------
it is a common phenomenon and an indisputable fact that[].There are many reasons of this phenomenon.Generally speaking,it is due to[].
Many factors interact together to[].Last but not least,..To sum up,..As we could predict,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22 ------------------------------
In my opinion,there are certain characteristics that all[]have in common.they are..Besides..
What is more,..What I have listed is not the complete set of characters of[],however,we can[]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23 ------------------------------
after thinking about it from several aspects,I do not believe it is a good idea.the reasons are presented below.
Another reason why I do not approve[]..Based on the above discussion,I do not think it is a good idea[].
Compared with..,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 24 ------------------------------
It is almost always the case that[].On the other hand..It is very normal that..,Furthermore,It is a matter of balance between the two features..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25 ------------------------------
There are both advantages and disadvantages of[].overall,I think it is good idea.
I am worried about..For those i'n worried about,..First of all,At the same time..it would be even worse because..
On the other hand,..As a result..In a short,there are several details to consider when..In my part,I support to have[]because its advantages outweigh
disadvantages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26 ------------------------------
There will be a hectic debate about whether to[]or not.The final aspect that makes the choice reasonable is that..
From what we have been discussed above,we may safely draw the conclusion that it is positive to[].
--------
Some people will say that[]would be a bad thing.However,I fully support the[].
As it stands there is..Overall,I support it fully.I hope that others will join me to convince[].
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27 ------------------------------
when it comes to the topic[],optimistic and pessimistic people have different attitudes toward this topic.
For me, a person who[],I would prefer to[],there are many reasons why I[].the first reason is that..
there are pros and cons for every experience.In addition,..All in all,it is..therefore,I agree that[].
--------
Many people strongly oppose this idea,while others insist that[]..personally,I would side with the latter.
A scrutiny of these arguments would reveal how..,still some people might list other reasons to explain why[]
However I assume the points I have discussed in the above analysis are the most relevant.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28 ------------------------------
Admittedly,..Furthermore,one of the significant results of[],In a sense,I do not quite appreciate[]
as far as I am concerned,I cannot agree more with the statement and my point of view is well founded.
It seems that..Another equally important aspect is that..besides..One of the most well known example[]
certainly I do not deny that..As far as I am concerned,I fully agree with that.safe to say more than 70%..
Not to mention there are..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29 ------------------------------
Take into account of all factors I think..the majority holds the opinion that[]
when it comes to[]..first of all,..In term of substantive level,no other reasons in my decision is more crucial than the one above.
Therefore,after pondering this question on many occasions,I believe that[]. In conclusion,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30 ------------------------------
I oppose having[].although I know there's a real need for[],I have to say that I don't want[].I think it would cause a lot of problems.
First af all,..This means that..Either way,this would mean a lot more[].
In addition to the[A],there also would be[B].Consequently,those[]would end up[].
I also have some concerns about..These are concerns that I don't think can be addressed sufficiently for me to support[].
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31 ------------------------------
some people prefer to..While others prefer to..
Looking back to my education and looking forward to my future career,I have been and will be..
but considering my personality,I would rather[].However,frankly speaking,..
For my part,I am inclined to believe that[].For me at least,in this particular time of[]I find it better to[]
However,as I would grow old I do believe my opinions in this matter will modify.
However,one needs to consider that not everyone seems..
I believe there are no uniform answers,but in my opinion,I do agree with the claim that[] is better than[].
As for me,when I was..we can see that many..After all,..It is right to say that..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32 ------------------------------
Some people say that it is better to[]while others prefer to[]It's a difficult choice faced by lots of people
because of the different attitudes they hold towards[].As far as I am concerned,I vote for the former choice which is that it is better for..,
[]is my preference because of three reasons as follows.First,we can observe in the modern society that the..,
In the old days,it is said that..,That is probably the reason why most of the people nowadays[].
The third obvious reason why I prefer[]rather than[]is that it is..In this broad view I prefer..ing rather than ..ing.

Depending on personal experience,personality type and emotional,we find that some people hold the idea of[],but others choose[]and that is also my point.
My arguments for this point are listed as follows.The main reason for[]..According to the three points above,we can reach[].
Another reason can be seen by everyone is that..Admittedly,[] also has advantages,but..So taking into account of all the factors that I have discussed
in the above analysis,I believe that it is more advisable to[]rather than[].
In my opinion,..For me,..
-----
some people believe that[],whereas others may agree that..As far as I am concerned,I prefer the latter point of view to the former.
I would like to substantiate my conclusion from the following perspectives.First of all,..Conversely,..what's more,..You must heard of the famous
commercial slogan..Admittedly,it might be true that[].However,[]turns out to be more practical and helpful for most of people according to the above reasons.
Consequently,I agree that[].
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34 ------------------------------
Consequently,after pondering this question on many occasions,I believe that[].my arguments for this view are based on the following points.
The main reason is that[].Further,it leads to..Moreover,it is not uncommon to..The above reason is but one of many factors,in addition to,..
Admittedly,[]has its own advantages,as a proverb says,'everything has two sides'.The most extreme manifestation is the fact that..
However,we have no complete evidence to agree that..Generally speaking,taking into account of all these factors,I do strongly disagree that..

whether[]should[]is relatively a subject of discussion as ..whereas..I personally believe that[]should[].If you look at all the..they are..

My answer is no,..But it is not realistic that..Firstly,on the[]side,..although this might sound[] but it is[],..

In conclusion,I believe it is not a good idea to..

From the above statements,it can be concluded that[]is not always good.It has its own negative influences on our life.

In my opinion,..So let us take a look..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39 ------------------------------
I agree with this statement..An overlooked aspect of[]is[].In conclusion I would like to say that[]has played major role not only in increasing the[]
but also in bringing a radical change in the way[].No doubt,..In the past,..On the other hand,..Yet in general,it is still true that..

[]may sound very[]and thus,it is understandable even if some people suggest it should be better[].It is true at some points because[].
